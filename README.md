Projeto Piano

This is an exercise from my Javascript / HTML / CSS classes on IEFP (Instituto do Emprego e Formação Porfissional).

It was asked to the trainees to create a a Piano with the keys matching the correct sound. The paino keys can be pressed using both the mouse or the keyboard.

This was made during Christmas season, so we had to embelish the project with something related to Christmas.
